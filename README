CS 342 Team Programming Project: Bioinformatics README


Our BTree is stored as a binary data file on the disk. The first part of the binary file is the metadata for the BTree.
The metadata includes the following:
      4 bytes - number of tree nodes
      4 bytes - the degree (t) of the BTree
      8 bytes - the byte offset of the root node.

Following the metadata, the file is a list of all of the nodes, with the following information for each node:
      8 bytes - global offset value
      1 byte  - leaf true/false
      4 bytes - number of tree objects contained in the node
      4 bytes - parent pointer
   2t*4 bytes - child pointers
2t-1*12 bytes - tree objects (31 bits for the frequency, 64 bits for the key value)

Cache Time Improvement
We found the improvement from using a cache, and from using a larger cache versus a small cache, to be as follows:
Running with Degree 2 and Sequence Length 2 on test1.gbk
Time running 943 ms with no cache: 
Time running 540 ms with cache size 100: 
Time running 534 ms with cache size 500:
